# Adventure Dice

### This is a terminal dice game based on the Steve Jackson Games dice-game "Zombie Dice".

the goal of the game is to roll dice that represents treasures that the adventurer finds the deeper they go into the temple. at each round the adventurer can either roll 3 dice to open the chests or end their turn and get the points they have collected so far, but if 4 traps are triggered the game is over and all loot is lost!
